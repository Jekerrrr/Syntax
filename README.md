# Syntax
Hello!, if you are reading this, thanks for downloading the code or for dropping by the repo! 
I wanted to ask you not to be pricks please :) that means dont try to publish malicious code or try to delete important code, and be civilized above all!
Now, if you want to do anything in the source code, go wild! this project is under the GNU license, have as much fun using Syntax as i have coding it!
Sinecerly,
-Jeker
